## Basic
Thereâ€™s not much to see here, but you can check out the [Modal](/docs/components/overlays/modal) and [Color Picker](/docs/components/colors/color-picker) documentation for more details.

<Note>
  Just a heads up: when you grab related components like `modal`, `sheet`, or `color-picker`, the dialog component gets included automatically. No need to worry about installing it separately.
</Note>
