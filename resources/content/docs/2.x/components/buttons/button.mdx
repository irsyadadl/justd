<How toUse="buttons/button/button-icon-demo" />

## With Only Icon
If you want to use only an icon, you can use the `size="square-petite"` prop to make it smaller.

## Disabled
When a button is disabled, it cannot be interacted with and is visually indicated by a disabled state.

<How toUse="buttons/button/button-disabled-demo" />

## Pending
A Button can indicate a pending state through the isPending prop. This helps when an action takes time to complete, offering users feedback that the process is ongoing. The pending state communicates the change to assistive technologies and disables interactions, except for focus.

## With Loader
You can also add loader to the button.

## Link
Sometimes, you need to use styles from buttons for links. Just use the link and use the `buttonStyles` to the className prop.
