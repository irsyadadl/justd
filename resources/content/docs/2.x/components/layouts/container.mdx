## Installation
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true }} items={['container']}/>

## Manual Installation
<SourceCode toShow='container'/>

## Intent
Containers come in two variants: `constrained` and `padded-content`. The `constrained` variant doesn't have padding on mobile view, while the `padded-content` variant has padding on both mobile and desktop. And the default variant is `padded-content`. If you want to change the variant, you can use the `intent` prop.
```
<Container intent="constrained" />
```
