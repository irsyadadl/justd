## Basic
ListBoxes can be enhanced with features like multi-selection, filtering, and dynamic data updates. They are widely used in applications to display and manage lists of options or data entries.

## Multiple Selection
To enable multiple selections, set the `selectionMode` prop to `multiple`. Since this prop has no default value, you must define it explicitly.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-multiple-demo" />

## Item Details
Enhance list items by providing additional details through the `ListBoxItemDetails` component.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-item-details-demo" />

## Section
Display items in a ListBox grouped by sections.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-section-demo" />

## Rearrange
Enable drag and drop functionality in the ListBox using the `dragAndDropHooks` prop with the `useDragAndDrop` hook. This allows for rearranging items, adding new entries between existing ones, or managing data across the entire list.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-rearrange-demo" />

## Controlled
Make sure you set the `selectionMode` prop to `single` to enable controlled mode. This will allow you to manage the ListBox selection by using the `selectedKey` prop.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-controlled-demo" />

## Disabled
Disable specific ListBox items.
<How toUse="collections/list-box/list-box-disabled-demo" />
You can also disable an item directly by passing the `isDisabled` prop to `ListBoxItem`.
```tsx
<ListBoxItem isDisabled>Disabled</ListBoxItem>
```
