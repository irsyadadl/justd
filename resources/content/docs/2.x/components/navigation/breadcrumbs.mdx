## Basic

Breadcrumbs display a trail of links that guide users to the current page or resource in an app, helping them understand their location and navigation path.

## Separator
This separator is displayed when the breadcrumb differs from the last one. There are three types of separators: `chevron`, `slash`, and `boolean`. By default, the chevron separator is used for non-identical breadcrumbs, but you can disable it by setting the `separator` prop to `false`. Additionally, you can set the separator to `slash` or `chevron` by using the props `separator="slash"` or `separator="chevron"`.

## Menu
You can also combine breadcrumbs with menus to create a more complex navigation structure.

## Collections
You can also use breadcrumbs to navigate between collections.

## Current
The current breadcrumb indicates the active page in the breadcrumb navigation. It is automatically added as the last item and its color is updated accordingly. But you can also control the color of the current breadcrumb by passing a `className` prop to the `Breadcrumbs.Item` component.
