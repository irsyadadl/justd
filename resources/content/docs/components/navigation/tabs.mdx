## With Icons
If you want to include icons in your tabs, it's simple to do. This tab setup handles icons smoothly, maintaining a clean design.

## Orientation
You can set the orientation of the tabs to either `horizontal` or `vertical`.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="navigation/tabs/tabs-orientation-demo" />

## Collections
Tabs can also be used within collections.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="navigation/tabs/tabs-collections-demo" />

## Links
If you want to use tabs as navigational links, you can add the `href` prop to the `Tab` component. This will automatically change the cursor to a pointer.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="navigation/tabs/tabs-link-demo" />

## Responsive
When tabs get crowded, they can become difficult to manage. To keep them organized and responsive, use the following approach:

<Composed text="Mix it up with a menu, select, or combo box, but this example focuses on mastering the select component." components={['select']}/>

## Disabled
You can disable all tabs by setting the `isDisabled` prop to `true`.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="navigation/tabs/tabs-disabled-demo" />

You can also disable individual tabs by setting the `isDisabled` prop for each one, like this:
```tsx
<Tab isDisabled id="c">Contact</Tab>
<Tab isDisabled id="a">About Us</Tab>
```
